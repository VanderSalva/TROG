Lessons from TROG:
-Apply at least 2X zoom for pixel art
-Scrolling is great
-The walls in Zelda are weird for a reason
-Do not make player character too small (can use subpixel precision with above)
-Do not make any player entity a global
-Do not make game manager a global
-Do not implement one's own map format
-Do not write your own map editor, use Tiled
-Do not make up your own serialising, use JSON
-Do not rely heavily on class inheritance
-Do not write a monolithic game manager
-Have a proper (continuous) collision system early on
-Have an animation system for entities' sprites early on
-Implement pathfinding and use it
-Make enemies more interesting
-Embedding Lua or Js (Duktape) can be useful for quests/NPCs/etc.
-Push back on damage should be a continuous motion rather than instant snap
-Sounds don't need to be the last thing added
-Have multiple bounding boxes, at least separate movement collision from hit detection
